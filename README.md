## About InDelible

### Abstract

TBD

### What is InDelible for?

### What is InDelible not for?

## Installation

### Required Software Dependencies

InDelible is written for Python2.7.* or Python3.7.*

InDelible requires the following software to be installed and in `$PATH`:

* [bedtools](https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  * **Note**: If using CRAM formated files with InDelible, bedtools v2.28 or later is required.
* [tabix](http://www.htslib.org/download/) 
* [bgzip](http://www.htslib.org/download/)

The python package Biopython requires a local install of [blast](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) in `$PATH` in order to function. This needs to be installed prior to [installing InDelible](#installing-InDelible).

### Installing InDelible

To install InDelible:

1. Clone the git repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/eugenegardner/Indelible.git
cd Indelible/
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

* for Python2:
```
virtualenv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

* for Python3:
```
python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install cython and other required packages:

```
pip install cython
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: If you get error(s) about pysam not being able to load specific libraries (like openssl, libbz2, etc.) that is a pysam problem related to htslib. Please see the pysam website to get help.

Indelible was tested with the following version of the packages in requirements.txt:

- cython v0.29.13
- numpy v1.17.2
- pandas v0.25.1
- pybedtools v0.8.0
- pyfaidx v0.5.5.2
- pysam v0.15.3
- scipy v1.3.1
- scikit-learn v0.21.3
  - **Note**: The random forest model provided in `data.zip` will likely only work with v0.21.3 of scikit-learn (see [this](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html#security-maintainability-limitations) link for an explanation why). Thus, if using a different version of scikit-learn, it is necessary to re-train the model with the provided test set included with this repository (`data/observation_data.DDD.17IX2019.txt`). Please see documentation [below](#_train) on how to train the random forest used by InDelible.
- PyYAML v5.1.2
- Biopython v1.74
- intervaltree v3.0.2

4. Unzip required data files:

```
cd data/
unzip data.zip
```


5. Download required blast resources:

```
## Download windowmasker:
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/windowmasker_files/9606/wmasker.obinary

## Download the GRCh37 human reference and create the blast db:
wget ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/technical/reference/phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/hs37d5.fa.gz
wget ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/technical/reference/phase2_reference_assembly_sequence/hs37d5.fa.gz.fai
makeblastdb -in hs37d5.fa -dbtype nucl
makeblastdb -in repeats.fasta -dbtype nucl
```

6. Edit the config file to point to required data files and edit any default parameters:

An example config.yml file (`example_config.yml`) is included in the top level directory. Edit this and save as `config.yml`.

```
cd ..

## Provide the path to each required file at the top of the config.yml
## Edit parameters at bottom of file.
vim example_config.yml

## cp/mv to config.yml
cp example_config.yml config.yml
```

Parameters in `config.yml` are as follows:

```
HC_THRESHOLD: Quality threshold at which to hard clip from the ends
MINIMUM_LENGTH_SPLIT_READ: Minimum number of bases that need to be soft clipped for a read to be included
MINIMUM_MAPQ: Minimum mapping quality for read to be included
MININUM_AVERAGE_BASE_QUALITY_SR: Minimum average base quality for the soft-clipped segment for read to be included
SHORT_SR_CUTOFF: The cutoff at which a soft-clipped segment is considered "short".
MINIMUM_SR_COVERAGE: Minimum number of reads with soft-clipped segments at a position for that position to be outputted.
SCORE_THRESHOLD: Minimum InDelible score to be considered for denovo calling
SR_THRESHOLD: Maximum number of clipped reads in parental samples to be considered inherited
COV_THRESHOLD: Minimum parental coverage to be able to call event as denovo
WINDOW_SIZE: window around position to look for indels/clipped reads (window_size/2 to the left and to the right)
```

**Note**: The above data resources will only work if you run InDelible using the the human GRCh37 reference. 

### Using vr-runner

InDelible comes packages with a script for use with the vr-runner packaged which automates the analysis of multiple 
samples. For information on how to install and use vr-runner, please see [this link](https://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/vr-runner).

The InDelible-specific vr-runner script is located at `./vr_runner/run-indelible`. This script requires a list of tab-delimited bam paths, where columns are:

1. child bam
2. mum bam
3. dad bam 

For example:

```
/path/to/child.bam  /path/to/mum.bam    /path/to/dad.bam
```

If mum or dad bams are not available, substitute a "-" like:

```
/path/to/child.bam  -   -
/path/to.child.bam  /path/to/mum.bam    -
/path/to.child.bam  - /path/to/dad.bam
```

A simple command for running InDelible with vr-runner is as follows:

```
./Indelible/vr_runner/run-indelible -o ./output/ -b crams.txt +maxjobs 1000 +loop 100 +retries -2
```

Resulting output will be in the `./output/` folder.

Additional commands for run-indelible:

```
   -b, --bams-list <file>      File with bam files
   -o, --outdir <dir>          Output directory
   -d, --database              Path to a precomputed MAF database [null]
```

***Note:*** If a filepath to a prebuilt MAF database (e.g. `./Indelible/data/`) is not provided for `-d/--database`, InDelible will rebuild the MAF database based only on samples included in `-b`!

### Primary SV Calling Pipeline

The InDelible variant calling process follows several steps:

1. [Fetch](#1-fetch) â€“ Soft-clipped reads are extracted from the BAM files 
2. [Aggregate](#2-aggregate) - Information is aggregated across reads to find positions where multiple reads are clipped.
3. [Score](#3-score) - Positions are scored using a Random Forest model taking into account the number/quality of clipped reads and the sequence context
4. [Blast](#4-blast) - Longer clipped segments are blasted against the human genome and repeat databases
5. [Annotate](#5-annotate) - Putative SVs are annotated with additional information (e.g. gene annotations) and the blast results from the previous step
6. [_denovo_](#6-denovo) - _de novo_ events are called and inheritance information is appended.

These different steps can be performed by the different sub-commands:

#### 1. Fetch

The **fetch** command extracts the reads from the BAM file, it takes 2 arguments:

* `--i` : path to the input CRAM/BAM file.
* `--o` : path to output the clipped reads to.

```
./indelible.py fetch --i test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam --o test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.sc_reads
```

#### 2. Aggregate

The **aggregate** merges information across reads towards a position-level view of the data:

* `--i` : path to the input file (the output of the *fetch* command from previous step).
* `--b` : path to the CRAM/BAM file used to generate the input file.
* `--o` : the path to the output file.
* `--r` : path to reference genome 

```
./indelible.py aggregate --i test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.sc_reads --b test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam --o DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.counts --r hs37d5.fasta
```

**Note**: It is recommended to [retrain](#train) the RandomForest following this step with data that you have manually inspected. 

#### 3. Score

The **score** command scores positions based on the read information and sequence context:

* `--i` : path to the input file (the output of the *aggregate* command from previous step).
* `--o` : the path to the output file.

```
./indelible.py score --i test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.counts --o test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.counts.scored
```

**Note**: It is highly recommended if analysing a large amount of data at once to rebuild the InDelible frequency database. Please see the [Database](#database) command below for instructions.

#### 4. Blast

The **blast** command blasts longer clipped segments (20+ bp) to find matches elsewhere in the human genome and/or repeat database:
* `--i` :  path to the input file (the output of the *score* command from previous step).

This will automatically generate 3 files: a fasta file with the sequences to be blasted, 2 results files (one for repeat sequences, one for non-repeat sequences). These files are used in the next step.

```
./indelible.py blast --i test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.counts.scored
```

#### 5. Annotate

The **annotate** command enriches the result with gene/exon annotations and merges the blast results with the position file:

* `--i` : path to the input file (output of score command after running the blast command).
* `--o` : path to output the annotated file.
* `--d` : path to the InDelible frequency database. A default frequency database from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders WES data is availible at `./Indelible/data/Indelible_db_10k.bed`. 

```
./indelible.py annotate --i test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.counts.scored --o test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.counts.scored.annotated --d data/InDelible_db_10k.bed
```

#### 6. Denovo

One can then look for *de novo* mutation events using the **denovo** command:

***Note***: If maternal and/or paternal bam files are not supplied, *denovo* filtering will not be performed. This behaviour is intended to format non-trio data identically to trio data. If one of maternal **or** paternal bam is provided, InDelible will count coverage within that sample.

* `--c` : path to scored/annotated calls in the proband.
* `--m` : path to maternal CRAM/BAM file. [optional]
* `--p` : path to paternal CRAM/BAM file. [optional]
* `--o` : path to output file.

```
./indelible.py denovo --c test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.InDelible.tsv --m maternal.bam --p paternal.bam --o test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam.InDelible.denovo.tsv
```

### Additional Commands

InDelible also includes several helper commands:

#### InDelible Complete

All steps in the InDelible calling pipeline can be performed in succession automatically with the **complete** command:

* `--i` : path to the input CRAM/BAM file.
* `--o` : path to directory where output files will be generated.
* `--r` : path to reference genome
* `--d` : path to the InDelible frequency [database](#database).
* `--m` : path to maternal CRAM/BAM file. [optional]
* `--p` : path to paternal CRAM/BAM file. [optional]
* `--keeptmp` : If this flag is given, intermediate files are kept. Otherwise these files will be removed once the analysis is finished.

```
./indelible.py complete --i test_data/DDD_MAIN5194229_Xchrom_subset_sorted.bam --o test_data/ --r hs37d5.fasta --keeptmp --m maternal.bam --p paternal.bam
```

For InDelible _de novo_ discovery behaviour when not providing maternal or paternal bams, please see [de novo](#6-denovo).

#### Database

The **database** command will generate the database required for the step [Annotate](#5-annotate). If analysing a large amount of data, it is highly recommended to run this command following running the [Score](#3-score) command.

* `--f` : file of files to merge to generate split read "allele frequencies"
* `--o` : output file to generate

```
ls InDelible_files/*.scored > fofn.txt
./indelible.py database --f fofn.txt --o InDelible_db.tsv
```

#### Train

The **train** command will run the active learning RandomForest on training data with annotations provided by manual inspection of data.

* `--i input training data`
* `--o output random forest`
* `--k number of samples to use for initial training and subsequent active selection [50].`
* `--s convergence parameter to stop learning at when accuracy does not improve by X% [0.01]`

The input data has identical columns to the output generated by [Aggregate](#2-aggregate), except with an additional column appended to the end of the file named "annotation". **Column names need to be identical!** See an example training file which can be used to regenerate the RandomForest used on the DDD data in `./data/`.

```
./indelible.py train --i input_training_data.txt --o output.pkl
```

**Note**: Remember to change the path to the RandomForest from `--o` in the ./config.yml file!
