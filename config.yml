# PARAMETERS:
# -----------
# HC_THRESHOLD: Quality threshold at which to hard clip from the ends
# MINIMUM_LENGTH_SPLIT_READ: Minimum number of bases that need to be soft clipped for a read to be included
# MINIMUM_MAPQ: Minimum mapping quality for read to be included
# MININUM_AVERAGE_BASE_QUALITY_SR: Minimum average base quality for the soft-clipped segment for read to be included
# SHORT_SR_CUTOFF: The cutoff at which a soft-clipped segment is considered "short".
# MINIMUM_SR_COVERAGE: Minimum number of reads with soft-clipped segments at a position for that position to be outputted.
# SCORE_THRESHOLD: Minimum Indelible score to be considered for denovo calling
# SR_THRESHOLD: Maximum number of clipped reads in parental samples to be considered inherited
#Â COV_THRESHOLD: Minimum parental coverage to be able to call event as denovo
# WINDOW_SIZE: window around position to look for indels/clipped reads (window_size/2 to the left and to the right)
